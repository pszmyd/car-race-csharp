# car-race-csharp
Your task will be to simulate a race. You will need to create 10 cars, 10 trucks, 10 motorcycles, and race them for 50 hours. After simulating the race print the results.  As a guideline here are the classes you will need to create and some of their functions/properties. Note that this is just a skeleton, feel free to add more methods/variables. But you must implement the ones described here!
